<h4>sharks being tangled in fishing nets is becoming a problem!</h4> 
 
<p><h3>over the past year ishermen have been creating bigger fishing nets to catch more fish 
but this has led to sharks being tangled in them causing death to strangulation.<h3></p>
 <p><h3>Fishermen have reported over 10,000 daths over the past year across America,
1 of those deaths had been a shark that was rescued from captivity and released into the ocean and the rescuers are devastated.<h3></p>
